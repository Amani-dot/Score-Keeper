# Score Keeper

This is simple game made with vanilla JS and some CSS.

You have 2 players that are competing to whoever reaches the winning goal first, they can select their own winning goal from the drop-down.

A player cannot continue playing if the other players reaches the winning goal first.

Whenever a new winning goal is set from the  drop-down the game resets.

The reset button also resets the game whenever a player wins.
